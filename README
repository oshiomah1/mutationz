# Functional Annotation of VCF files

To  annotate your vcf files, you need to run "new_run_snpeff.sh". You
will need your vcf file, reference genome and snpeff.jar. SNPEFF is
already an installed module by the HPCC Biocore. the reference genome is
also a folder in snpeff. I am using
**GRCh38.v42 but you can switch to your desired genome**

BEFORE RUNNING : Clone my repo and edit almost every line in
new_run_snpeff.sh so that you specify your desired input, output
folders, file locations, naming system and reference genome etc

-   **Scripts** (Definitions coming soon)

-   run_snp_eff.slurm -- slurm version of script above but can't get it
    to work because of memory issues with Java needing 8GB of free disk
    space and the SLURM cluster space limits

-   check_var_types.sh -- checks what kinds of mutations are in the info
    column of vcf
